However, we will use the data to solve a different (completely nonsense) problem.  The dataset CSV files are provided on Carmen.  They are:\n","- aisles.csv\n","- departments.csv\n","- products.csv\n","- order_products__train_**teb_subset**.csv  (This is a small'ish subset of the full Instacart transaction dataset. If you are brave, have free time on your hands and have a relatively powerful computer, you can try the full dataset, available at the URL listed above.  This is not necessary, though, and be sure to hand in the answers resulting from the smaller dataset.)\n","\n","The objectives of this assignment are:\n","- Practice the Association Analysis content we covered this semester.\n","- Understand “why” the particular topics, techniques, etc., are important from a practical perspective.\n","- Understand how to choose and use appropriate tools to solve the provided problems.\n","\n","### Dataset Notes\n","- The \"order_products_...\" data file captures the data in \"long format\". Specifically, every row corresponds to the transaction id and the item. If the specific transaction id has multiple items, there will be multiple rows in the data.\n","- You can process the data however you like, but it is recommended you convert into a one-hot-encoded data structure. This will allow you to easily use the mlxtend package.\n","\n","## The Business Problem\n","- Assume the provided dataset contains all of the transactions for one month for our store (Trader Buck's).  We wish to find association rules that will improve our revenue as follows:\n","  - Each month, we will choose a particular **\"Aisle of the Month\"**. We will discount all products in that aisle by 10% each month, with the hope that this will encourage customers to visit our store to purchase those products 5% more frequently, and also purchase other products in other aisles (that are not discounted) more frequently.\n","  - For simplicity, assume the normal price of all products is $1.00 (a bargain!)\n","- Practically speaking, we want to come up with **two-item** rules (one antecedent and one consequent: (A -> B)) and choose the ones that best add to our revenues  (based on the rule support, confidence, etc.).\n","\n","### Proper Answers\n","- **IMPORTANT:** **Show your work** and **explain it**.  This will help us give partial credit in some cases.\n","\n","### Collaboration\n","For this assignment, you must work as an individual. You may informally discuss ideas with classmates, but your work must be your own.\n","\n","### What You Need to Turn In\n","- Submit this Jupyter Notebook in .IPYNB format.  Do not \"zip\" the file.\n","\n","### Notes\n","- Feel free to use the **mlxtend** package throughout this assignment.\n","- If a question asks you to \"calculate\" the number of \"all possible rules\", etc., explain the calculation by showing the \"formula\" you used. This will act as \"showing your work\".\n","***"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"tags":[],"id":"nG7I04baLGBv"},"source":["***\n","# Section: 1 - Get Ready\n","1A) Load the data, and get it ready for association analysis.

It is because apriori can prune supersets and save the time. Setting the minimum support is based on my experiments. I set to minimum support 0.05 because there 15,471 orders in the dataset, and 774 orders need to be contained for each frequent item. I think this value looks fine for mining the optimal rules. Also, it can create a set of about 50 to 100 two-item sets. The highest support within two-item sets is about 0.33, and two-item set is {fresh vegetables, fresh fruits}. The lowest support within two-item sets is about 0.05, and two-item set is {fresh vegetables, creal}."],"metadata":{"id":"gjOxyY3kvC7S"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"2jsMhQlWLGB1"},"source":["***\n","# Section: 4 - Generate Rules\n","- For the two-itemsets created above, create the related rules.\n","***"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":18,"metadata":{"tags":[],"id":"mNR-3eS0LGB1","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1701448571977,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":10,"user":{"displayName":"CHAEUN HONG","userId":"02599815208094586821"}},"outputId":"df4823c9-eecb-4e3b-9261-b1626067e96e"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["/usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/ipykernel/ipkernel.py:283: DeprecationWarning: `should_run_async` will not call `transform_cell` automatically in the future.

The hardest one in this homework was large dataset to find rules. The number of orders in the orders data is 15,471, and the number of products in the orders data is 20,605. Therefore, the items (products) distribution is too sparse to mining the meaningful rules. Also, the data is high complexity and time consumed to find appropriate rules. Instead of using original orders data, I grouped the orders data with the aisle data. In this case, I used only 134 items to create rules. As a result, I found that the best AOTM is fresh herbs and two rules - {fresh herbs} -> {fresh vegetables} and {fresh herbs} -> {fresh fruits}. There is slight decrease revenue due to discount of prices in fresh herbs aisle, but there is increase revenue due to associate products. So, I can expect $965 increased revenue based on the rules. I can understand how to use association rule in the real world and how association rule is practical for a decision of AOTM and similar problems."],"metadata":{"id":"6nt_KRD0A2M-"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["***\n","# Section: 7 - References\n","***"],"metadata":{"id":"VeYBnmsVQ4dA"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["* Vernier, S.
